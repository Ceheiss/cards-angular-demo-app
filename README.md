# Cards Angular Demo App

This app is made for educational purposes to compare an identical app made with React and with Angular.

The app is super simple, just displays different cards with names and images... WOW yes I know.

Anyhow, here is the sibling [React App Repo](https://github.com/Ceheiss/cards-react-demo-app)

and here is this [deployed repo](https://cards-angular-demo-app.vercel.app/)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.3.
